# Morpheus
Morpheus is a program for Linux that adds a customisable selection of pentesting tools to any Debian distro out of the box. It was created so that any distribution can easily aquire specific functions that only distributions such as Kali and Parrot have, effectively making any linix distro a pentesting distro, along with many other tools and programs that such distributions do not provide.
